Pull request checklist:
 - [ ] Features and bugfixes should be merged to the `develop` branch, **not** `main`
 - [ ] All text should be internationalized
 - [ ] There should be no linter errors
 - [ ] New features should support all states (loading, error, etc) 

Thanks for keeping it clean! Feel free to merge your own pull request after it has been approved - just use the "squash & merge" option please.
